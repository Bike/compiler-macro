(defdoc parse-macro function
  "Given a NAME, LAMBDA-LIST, BODY, and optionally an ENVIRONMENT (default NIL, designating the null lexical environment), return a lambda expression, the evaluation of which is suitable as a macroexpansion function.
I.e., (eval (parse-macro 'name 'lambda-list 'body env)) and (macro-function (defmacro name lambda-list . body) env) [evaluated in env] should be functions with the same effects.")

(defdoc parse-compiler-macro function
  "Like PARSE-MACRO, but the lambda expression is suited for use as a compiler macro.  Meaning it's the same, except that if it's provided a form beginning with FUNCALL to expand it will still destructure its arguments appropriately.")

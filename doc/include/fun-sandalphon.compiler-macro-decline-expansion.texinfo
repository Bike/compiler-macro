@deffn {Function} {decline-expansion} &optional datum &rest args
This function should be called by compiler macroexpanders that reach a point such that they do not wish to expand.

If @code{datum} is provided, @code{note-optimization-failure} is called with @code{datum} and @code{args} to inform the programmer of the situation.

Regardless of whether @code{datum} is provided, if called in the appropriate dynamic context, a non-local control transfer will immediately occur, halting expansion.

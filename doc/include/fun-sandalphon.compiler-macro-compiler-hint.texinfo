Retrieve the hint function for @code{name}, identified by @code{qual} compared via @code{cl:equal}.

A hint function is a function of two arguments, a form and an environment, and which returns a form with the same semantics as @code{form} but (hopefully) more efficient.  A hint function should be prepared to receive a form beginning with its name, or a form beginning with @code{cl:funcall}.

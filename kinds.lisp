(defun kindp (type kind &optional environment)
  "Like TYPEP, but for types themselves - TYPE is a type, and KIND is a kind designator.  \"kinds\" are like types of types; for example, we might say that (array * (3)) is of kind ARRAY-TYPE.  Reasoning about types in this fashion is frequently useful in reasoning about programs.

Possible kind designators are:

INTERSECTION-TYPE: Kind of (AND ...)
UNION-TYPE: Kind of (OR ...)
MEMBER-TYPE, EQL-TYPE, SATISFIES-TYPE are as is obvious from their names.
NEGATION-TYPE: Kind of (NOT ...)

CONS-TYPE, ARRAY-TYPE, SEQUENCE-TYPE, COMPLEX-TYPE, NUMERIC-TYPE are all as obvious, covering both atomic and compound (if this is applicable) types of their names.  CONDITION-TYPE is similar, and included because the CL standard doesn't prescribe any particular representation for the class of CONDITION.

BOTTOM-TYPE is used exclusively for NIL, the type of no objects.

Other kinds are already integrated with CLOS.  E.g., STRUCTURE-CLASS (the name, or the class itself) is the kind of structure types, and CLASS is the kind of classes.

Compound kind designators are available.  EQL, OR, AND, and NOT are analogous to the same operators of types.  SUBTYPE can be used to designate the kind of all subtypes of a given type; that is, (kindp [t1] '(subtype [t2])) is the same as (subtypep [t1] [t2])."

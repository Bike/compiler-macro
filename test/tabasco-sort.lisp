;;;; Modified by Bike for use in sandalphon.compiler-macro.
;;;; macro SORT is renamed INLINE-SORT
;;;; package renamed
;;;; all sbcl hooks replaced
;;;; documentation changed slightly appropriately
;;;; package exports INLINE-SORT, SORT, STABLE-SORT rather than just SORT
;;;; add requirement for alexandria (to avoid sb-kernel:%coerce-callable-to-fun, and because with-gensyms is darn convenient)

;;;; unmodified at http://discontinuity.info/~pkhuong/tabasco-sort.lisp

;;;; Tabasco Sort v 1.0.1
;;;;
;;;; Generates relatively-small unrolled and inlined stable merge
;;;; sorts.
;;;;
;;;; Usage:
;;;; (tabasco:inline-sort (#'< :key #'-)
;;;;   (aref array 0) (aref array 1) (aref array 2))
;;;; will sort the values in ARRAY's first, second and third slots,
;;;; write the values back in order, and return them as multiple
;;;; values.
;;;;
;;;; The predicate and key function are interpreted exactly as in
;;;; CL:STABLE-SORT.
;;;;
;;;; (tabasco:inline-sort (#'< :overwrite nil) ...) will sort the values,
;;;; without writing them back to the places.  If the overwrite
;;;; argument is a literal NIL, the overwriting code is never
;;;; even emitted, and the macro will work without any issue on
;;;; non-place values (e.g. function calls).
;;;;
;;;; See http://pvk.ca/Blog/2012/08/27/tabasco-sort-super-optimal-merge-sort/
;;;; for more in-depth explanations.
;;;;
;;;; Release history
;;;;
;;;; * 2012-08-28
;;;;  Only enable the transform when (> speed compilation-speed) or
;;;;  when SBCL's generic sort would be inlined anyway.
;;;;  Suggested by Lutz Euler on #sbcl.
;;;;
;;;; * 2012-08-26
;;;;  Initial release: stable merge sort generator and SBCL hooks.

;;;; opticl.lisp

;;;; http://cyrusharmon.org/blog/display?id=113 but with this library.

;;;; three versions:
;;;; /opticl is a pretty basic translation of the original.
;;;; /opticl-ecase works by putting a compiler macro on ecase instead, and relying on the implementation for inlining.
;;;; /opticl-simple is supposed to have the same effects, but with the "cleanest" code.  in that it is twenty lines.
;;;; (not counting the utility functions that are more or less part of the library)

;;;; and after that, a few notes.

Which is exactly the same disassembly as generated with opticl:pixel.  But now the definition is a bit clearer/modular/I like it more; or more concretely, PIXEL is now a normal function, that can be funcalled/applied/etc. with some loss of efficiency.  Having the function definition include the ECASE partial inlining would make such un-compiler-macro'd calls more efficient (having only to branch at runtime, given a sufficiently small channel count.)

Of course there could be improvements.  "don't know how to extract array dimensions from type T" isn't very helpful, so maybe it would be nice to rewrite array-type-dimensions-or-give-up to print something like "insufficient declaration information to optimize based on type of form ~s".  Or derive-array-type-dimensions could be used, and hints could define their own errors.  Or error checking in general could be improved, more type util stuff, more macros for less (or [...] (error ...)) crap.

Warning conditions could be classes instead of defaulting to simple-optimization-note, so a sufficiently irritated programmer could (handler-bind ((optimization-type-warning #'muffle-warning)) (asdf:compile-system ....)) [does that even work?  i doubt it] without necessarily losing other information they may care more about.

Something like (but quite different from, really) generic functions would be nice syntactically and otherwise.  E.g., the rank 2 case would be written as

(define-compiler-method pixel ((image (array * 2)) y x)
  "yet more partial inlining (for known rank 2 images)"
  `(aref ,image ,y ,x))

Here the string is a regular docstring, not a qualifier (not something i really like anyway) since the types handle uniqueness, like they mostly do with real methods.

Imagining further, we could have pattern matching, allowing the third case to be (with some added declarations because why not)

(define-compiler-method pixel (&whole form (image (array * (* * dim))) y x &environment env)
  "rank three"
  (when (or (> n 9) ; don't bother if there are enough channels to overflow registers anyway (9 is arbitrary here)
            (policy (> space speed) env)) ; probably doesn't actually take up too much space, but eh
    (decline-expansion))
  (once-only (image y x)
    `(values ,@(loop for i from 0 below dim collect `(aref ,image ,y ,x ,i)))))

This meaning that the expansion should only occur if image is known to be a rank three array, and further that the third dimension must be known, and that it is bound as DIM within the body of the method.  (alternately it could catch * as well, requiring a check in the body?  eh)

(also note that &whole and &environment are still available.)

Bla bla method combinations other CLOS goodness who knows.
